# 📘 Student Exam Performance Predictor

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Web Application** that predicts a student’s **exam score** based on study habits, attendance, parental involvement, access to resources, extracurricular activities, and sleep hours.

It uses **Linear Regression** and a colorful **Streamlit interface** to provide an attractive and user-friendly experience.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

* `Hours_Studied` → Number of hours studied daily
* `Attendance` → Attendance percentage
* `Parental_Involvement` → Level of parental support (1-5 scale)
* `Access_to_Resources` → Availability of study resources (1-5 scale)
* `Extracurricular_Activities` → Participation (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Sleep_Hours` → Average daily sleep hours
* `Exam_Score` → Target variable (student’s exam marks)

Example data:

| Hours\_Studied | Attendance | Parental\_Involvement | Access\_to\_Resources | Extracurricular\_Activities | Sleep\_Hours | Exam\_Score |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 2              | 60         | 2                     | 3                     | 1                           | 6            | 55          |
| 5              | 80         | 3                     | 4                     | 0                           | 7            | 70          |
| 9              | 95         | 5                     | 5                     | 1                           | 8            | 90          |
